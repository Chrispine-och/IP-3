# description
* Delani-Studio is a Portfolio landing page that gives our users a detailed explanation of some of our works. The pictorial representation of our projects lets our users experience the reality of what we do as designers. The page has been done with html and styled with both css bootsrap. Jquery was also a crucial tool in the behaviour of hover effects of our project samples. Also in handy, was javascript which was used as a backend tool. User information is collected through forms and also intergrated, is the MailChimp API which lets us keep track of our subscribers.
